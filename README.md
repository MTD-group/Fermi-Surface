# Fermi-Surface
VASP subtool to draw Fermi-Surface; creates input file for Xcrysden

This script is to draw fermi surface based on first-principles calculation result. This takes standard VASP (The Vienna Ab initio simulation package) output files.

As a result input file for Xcrysden software (http://www.xcrysden.org/) will be generated with bxsf format.

Detailed manual and process is also attached as pdf (`Manual and Process.pdf`).
